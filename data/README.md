# Data folder

The contents of the data folder, excluding MinION FAST5 reads can be found on the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5p0c3) as doi:10.5061/dryad.5p0c3.

This repository includes only the files that should be of the greatest interest to most people, the FASTQ reads from the lambda phage and snake transcriptome data sets. The lambda 1D reads have been split into two parts, to comply with GitHub file size policies. The references are available on GitHub for lambda [here](https://github.com/mikheyev/MinION-review/blob/master/ref/lambda_ref.fasta) and for for the snake transcriptome [here](https://github.com/mikheyev/MinION-review/blob/master/ref/protobothrops_ref.fasta).
