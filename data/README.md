# Data folder

The contents of the data folder, excluding MinION FAST5 reads can be found on the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5p0c3) as doi:10.5061/dryad.5p0c3.

The two data files included with this repository, and are probably of the greatest interest to most people, are the FASTQ reads from the lambda phage and snake transcriptome data sets. The references are available on GitHub for lambda [here](https://github.com/mikheyev/MinION-review/blob/master/ref/lambda_ref.fasta) and for for the snake transcriptome [here](https://github.com/mikheyev/MinION-review/blob/master/ref/protobothrops_ref.fasta).
