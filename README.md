## Data

The complete contents of the data folder will eventually be found on the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5p0c3) as doi:10.5061/dryad.5p0c3

Currently the data folder includes the raw data in FASTQ format. If you need any other files, please contact the authors.

## Analysis folder (src)

All of the analysis scripts in this folder were written to run on OIST's tombo cluster and may require some modification in order to work on a standalone computer.
